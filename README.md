## I worked on analyzing an Amazon sales dataset to derive actionable insights and provide recommendations for improving business strategies. My responsibilities included data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python.  

## Key tasks involved:  
- Handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.  
- Conducting time-series analysis to identify peak sales periods, with April emerging as the highest sales month.  
- Analyzing product performance to determine top-selling categories (e.g., T-shirts) and identifying size preferences, with "M" being the most popular.  
- Performing geographical analysis to highlight key regions like Maharashtra and Bengaluru for targeted marketing efforts.  
- Assessing customer spending behavior, revealing a majority of medium spenders, and evaluating fulfillment methods, with Amazon leading in order processing efficiency.  

The insights provided led to actionable recommendations, such as focusing on seasonal demand, improving inventory management for popular items, leveraging regional demand insights, and enhancing partnerships with retailers. These findings helped optimize sales strategies, fulfillment processes, and customerÂ targeting
